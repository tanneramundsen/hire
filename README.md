Iteration 2: (Things to note when testing)
- Currently, all the SIS classes in the CS department are added into our courses databases when you open the site. 
- There are 5 sample applicants that you can log in as: tamunds1, jlin123, mrajmoh1, dtorre17, xhuynh1. 
  - These applicants are currently "interested" in all of the classes in the CS department.
  - You can also create your own student account and select classes you are interested in.
  - After you sign in as a student, you will be directed to a landing page with all the classes you are interested in. 
  - Students can update their profile information through "My Profile". This includes:
      - Ranking their top 3 classes (out of the classes that the student is interested in)
      - Adding any grades for classes that the student has taken (other classes have the grade "Not Taken). 
      - Note that once the student updates this information, it persists the next time the student clicks on "My Profile"
- There are no sample professors but you can create a professor account through the sign up page.
  - When creating a professor account, choose all the courses that the professor is teaching
  - For each course, the professor can click on "Manage Course" to see a list of hired applicants and interested applicants.
  - When the professor clicks on an applicant's name in these lists, they will be able to see the profile of the student including their name, email, jhed, ranked courses, and grades (if the student has inputted this information)
