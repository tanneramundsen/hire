- There are 5 sample applicants that you can log in as: tamunds1, jlin123, mrajmoh1, dtorre17, xhuynh1. 
  - These applicants are currently "interested" in all of the classes in the CS department.
      - Tanner Amundsen has Head CA interest in all the classes

  - You can also create your own student account and select classes you are interested in.
  - After you sign in as a student, you will be directed to a landing page with all the classes you are interested in. 
  - Students can update their profile information through "My Profile". This includes:
      - Personal information including: Year, major, hours etc. (we mirrored the current CA application)
          - Some of these fields are required!
      - Ranking their top 3 classes (out of the classes that the student is interested in)
      - Adding any grades for classes that the student has taken (other classes have the grade "Not Taken).
      - Indicating interest in a head CA position for a specific class
      - Note that once the student updates this information, it persists the next time the student clicks on "My Profile"
  - Students can now click on a course to see additional information including: the professor who is hiring for this course, a course description (if the professor has added one), and the application status.
- There are no sample professors but you can create a professor account through the sign up page.

  - For each course, the professor can click on "Manage Course" see a list of interested applicants, shortlisted applicants and hired applicants.
