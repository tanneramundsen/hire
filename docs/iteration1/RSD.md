# Requirement Specification Document

## Problem Statement 

> Write a few sentences that describes the problem you are trying to solve. In other words, justify why this software project is needed.

The CA hiring/tracking/payroll process can be super tedious and unorganized since there are so many needs and things to keep track off.

## Potential Clients
> Who are affected by this problem (and would benefit from the proposed solution)? I.e. the potential users of the software you are going to build.

The potential clients for this software include students applying for CA positions, staff members who are hiring/tracking student CAs as well as office staff who take care of the payroll information.

## Proposed Solution
> Write a few sentences that describes how a software solution will solve the problem described above.

A software system to monitor CAs in the department by streamlining all processes from the initial applications/hiring, to tracking timesheets, to CA evaluations at the end of the semester and more.

## Functional Requirements
> List the (functional) requirements that software needs to have in order to solve the problem stated above. It is useful to write the requirements in form of **User Stories** and group them into those that are essential (must have), and those which are non-essential (but nice to have).


### Must have
- As a staff member looking to hire CAs, I want to filter CA applications based on the candidate's qualifications and availability.
- As a staff member looking to hire CAs, I want to easily see candidate's availability for interviews and schedule interviews during free time slots.
- As a staff member looking to hire CAs, I want to keep track of the applications and note when I conduct interviews/hire students.
- As a CA applicant, I want to have an all-in-one and intuitive application where I can input all my qualifications and availability so I can apply for many positions through one application.
- As a CA applicant, I always know the status of my application and be notified of changes (getting an interview, getting hired etc.).
- As a hired student CA, I want to be reminded every week to enter my hours for payroll.
- As a staff member, I want to be notified when CAs complete their time sheets and remind them if necessary.


### Nice to have

- As a staff member who hired many CAs, I want the student CA's semester course schedule's linked so that I can effectively assign section availability.
- As a staff member looking to hire CAs, I want automatic generation of hiring confirmation details as well as automatic CA contracts for each student.
- As a recently hired CA, I want to be able to easily and digitally sign all my contracts and set up my payroll information.
- As a staff member, I want to be able to input CA evaluations at the end of the semester to note my experiences with the student CA.



## Software Architecture
> Will this be a Web/desktop/mobile (all, or some other kind of) application? Would it conform to the Client-Server software architecture? 

This will be a web-based app. The clients are the users (staff members and students) and they input all their respective information onto the server (web app).
